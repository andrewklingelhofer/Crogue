1. This is just for fun.
2. As of this moment, I've found one bug. When the character picks up INVENTORYSIZE amount of
	 specific items, if you "break" that item (durability becomes 0), then drop the second item
	 in that item slot, the third item becomes unable to be equipped or dropped. However, once
	 you pick up more items of that type, the item becomes droppable/equipable again.
3. There is no objective yet because there are many aspects of the game that I haven't decided
	 on yet.
