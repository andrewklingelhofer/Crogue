1. This is just for fun.
2. As of this moment, I see one bug. In some positions near the edge of the map, there can be one space where the tile doesn't print. Still not sure what this is caused from, but it doesn't seem to break anything in the game.
3. There is no objective yet because there are many aspects of the game that I haven't decided on.
4. If you have any suggestions or additions, please let me know.
