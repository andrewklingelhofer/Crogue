# Crogue

3:15 p.m. - 5/26/15

***To compile, use "gcc -lncurses game.c -o game"
... The <ncurses.h> library isn't standard***

1. This is just for fun.
2. As of this moment, there are no known bugs. If any are found, the issues section will be updated.
3. I've begun adding and creating new characters with different attributes. I plan to begin creating a lore and background to the world of Crogue. Soon I will be adding new features, potions, attributes, items, levels, creatures and other objects to the game. Now that I have a working base for the game, this should be fairly easy to implement. Rather than focus on how the game mechanics work, I can now focus on how to populate the game world to make it interesting.
4. If you have any suggestions or additions, please let me know.
